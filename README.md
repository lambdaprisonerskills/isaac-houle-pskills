Landing Page for the Prisoner Skills App.

Pitch: This app allows prison management to broadcast the skill of inmates to make better use of their time using their skills to make a wage and becoming more employable after prison.

MVP Features Breakdown:

This app contains two user types. A prison admin (who has the ability to log in) and a single user (no need to log in so no need for user data to be persisted on this user type) who can view posted profiles by prison.

This repo contains the marketing page for the app. The marketing page styling is based on the html5Up template forty. Its main color is #242943 with multiple secondary colors: #6fc3df, #8d82c4, #ec8d81, #e7b788, #8ea9e8 and #87c5a4.

The marketing page is built primarily with flexbox, and the main grid section is made with CSS Grid. It includes a reusable box component with mouseover animations. The page has been CSS reset, with font-sizes defined in variables.
